# How this works ⚙️

<div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Unity and create a 3D project</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag all components in Assets folder into your project</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open CudeAvade Scene in Scenes folder and you're done</li>
  </ul>
</div>

# How to play 🎮

<div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Control:</strong> press A to move the 🍆 to the left and D to move it to the right </li>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Try your best not to be hit by 🔴 and catch as many 🟨 as you can </li>
    <li><strong>Additional:</strong> Intense soundFX, therefore:
        <ul>
          <li> Use a headphone 🎧 </li>
          <li> Remove Audio in the Sound list of the AudioManger GameObject 🛠️ </li>
          <li> Mute if you prefer not wanting to play it in a crowded environment 🔇 </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
